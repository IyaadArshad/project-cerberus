Baron -Cohen et al.  eyes test  The challenge in psychology is developing tests sensitive to subtle cognitive dysfunction, particularly in social cognition  Social cognition involves understanding and processing social interactions, emotions, and behaviours  . While there are many tests for young children, few exist for adults with normal intelligence who may have mild social understanding deficits. The "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" Test, developed by Baron -Cohen et al.  1997 , is designed to assess an adult s ability to understand another person's mental state by analyzing the eye -region of faces. This test measures theory of mind, which involves attributing mental states to others, though it only addresses the first stage of theory of mind  identif ying the mental state, not its content  e.g. compassion for her mother s loss . The "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" Test showed that adult males scored an average of 18.8, while females scored slightly higher at 21.8. Adults with high-functioning autism  HFA  or Asperger Syndrome  AS  scored significantly lower  16.3  compared to sex -matched controls and adults with Tourette s syndrome  TS , who scored similarly to the general population  20.4 . The test successfully identified subtle mind -reading difficulti es in adults with HFA or AS, supporting previous findings in children with autism. This demonstrated that normal adults can judge mental states from minimal facial cues, leading to further considerations for improving the test. AIM The main aims were  1. To test adults with high -functioning autism  HFA   Asperger syndrome IASI on the revised eyes test to see if the deficits on the original test were still seen . 2. To see if there is a negative correlation between autism spectrum quotient  AQ  and eyes test scores. 3. To see ff females score higher on the eyes test than males.

SAMPLE   Group 1  Adults with Asperger Syndrome  AS  or High -Functioning Autism  HFA   N   15, all male . They were diagnosed based on established criteria and had normal IQ scores  mean   115, SD   16.1  on the WAIS -R.   Group 2  Normal adults  N   122  from various occupations and educational backgrounds, including both employed and unemployed individuals. Data on age was available for 88 participants.   Group 3  Normal university students  N   103, 53 male, 50 female  from Cambridge University, primarily with high IQ due to stringent entrance requirements.   Group 4  A general population sample  N   14  IQ -matched with Group 1  mean   116, SD   6.4 , with no significant differences in IQ or age between Groups 1 and 4. PROCEDURE Participants in all four groups took the revised eyes test in a quiet room, alone, in either Exeter or Cambridge. The test required them to select which of four words matched the expression of a set of eyes. There was one correct answer and three foils for each set of eyes. Participants with HFA  AS  Group 1  were also asked to determine the gender of the eyes as a control task. The other groups did not need to do this as neurotypical adults  scores have a ceiling effect. Participants were also asked if they were unsure of any words in the glossary and to read the meaning of these. Problems with the original eyes test   Narrow Score Range   Increased the number of items from 25 to 36 and expanded response options from 2 to 4, allowing for a broader score range and reducing ceiling effects.   Distinguishing the "Broader Phenotype"  The previous version couldn't differentiate between individuals with autism and their relatives. The revised version aimed to improve this by increasing the score range.   Complex vs. Basic Mental States   The original test included easy -to-guess basic emotions, which were removed in the revised version, focusing only on complex mental states for greater challenge.   Gaze Direction Clues   Items based on gaze direction  e.g., "noticing" or "ignoring"  were excluded, ensuring a more accurate measure of mind -reading ability.Gender Bias   The original version had more female faces, so the revised test balanced the number of male and female faces to avoid bias.   Difficult Foil Words   Foil words were made more similar in emotional valence to the target word, increasing the difficulty of distinguishing mental states.   Comprehension Issues  A glossary of terms was added to help participants with language difficulties, ensuring that vocabulary comprehension didn t affect performance. Eyes Test Development    Target words and foils   Developed by the first two authors and piloted on eight judges  four male, four female . The criterion for selecting words was that at least five out of eight judges agreed on the target word being the most suitable description, with no more than two judges selecting any foil. Items that didn't meet this criterion were revised and re  piloted.   Item analysis   Data from Groups 2 and 3 were combined, resulting in a sample of N   225. New criteria were applied  at least 50  of participants had to select the target word, and no more than 25  could select any foil. Items not meeting these criteria were dropped, leaving 36 items.   Glossary   A glossary of mental state terms was provided to participants. RESULTS   Group 1  Adults with HFA AS  performed significantly worse on the Eyes Test than the other groups, suggesting that individuals with high -functioning autism or Asperger syndrome have more difficulty reading mental states from the eyes compared to normal adults and students.   Females scored higher than males on the Eyes Test , but this difference was not statistically significant, meaning it might be due to chance or other factors.   Group 1 scored significantly worse on the Autism Spectrum Quotient  AQ  than Groups 3 and 4. This indicates that adults with HFA AS have more traits associated with autism, as measured by the AQ, than normal adults or university students.   Males scored higher than females on the AQ, meaning men generally exhibited more traits related to autism compared to women in the sample.   There was no correlation between Eyes Test score and IQ , indicating that the ability to interpret mental states from the eyes is not directly related to general intelligence.   A negative correlation of -0.531 between the AQ score and Eyes Test score for all groups suggests that as the number of autistic traits  measured by AQ  increases, the ability to read mental states from the eyes decreases. This implies that individuals with more autistic traits struggle more with interpreting emotions or mental states from facial expressions.   In the student group, Eyes Test scores were negatively correlated with social skills and communication categories of the AQ. This suggests that students with poorer social and communication skills tend to score lower on the Eyes Test, meaning they have difficulty understanding mental states from facial expressions.Adults with HFA AS scored highly  33 out of 36 or above  on the gender recognition task, indicating that their difficulty is specific to recognizing mental states from eyes, not general face recognition. CONCLUSIONS The revised Eyes Test proved to be a more sensitive tool for measuring adult social intelligence compared to the original version. Neurotypical adults scored significantly below the ceiling, allowing the test to better detect subtle individual differences in social understanding. Adults with HFA AS showed impairment on the test but were able to successfully identify gender in the control task, confirming that the Eyes Test can effectively detect subtle social impairments in adults with normal IQs and differentiate them from control groups. The negative correlation between AQ  Autism Spectrum Quotient  scores and Eyes Test scores suggests that both tests can be used together to assess the severity of autistic traits , with higher AQ scores corresponding to poorer performance on the Eyes Test. EV ALUATIONS Ethical issues - An ethical weakness of the study is the potential psychological harm to participants with HFA AS , as they may have struggled to understand the emotions depicted in the eyes, leading to distress or embarrassment. This could result in lowered self -esteem after the test. Methodological issues   Reliability - A strength of the study is its high level of standardization , with all participants viewing the same 36 pairs of eyes, consistent image size, black -and-white format, and four response options. A glossary of terms was also provided. This ensures reliability and allows other researchers to replicate the study and re -examine findings, such as the gender differences. Methodological issues   Validity - Lack of Random Allocation  The study could not randomly allocate participants to groups due to naturally occurring variables  e.g., diagnosis of HFA AS, male female . This may have led to participant variables within each group, potentially affecting performance on the Eyes Test an d reducing the validity of the results. Differences observed between groups may not have been solely due to the independent variable. Methodological issues   Validity - Theory of Mind  The study may not have fully measured theory of mind as claimed. It only assessed the first stage of theory of mind  recognizing mental states  without considering the second stage, which involves understanding the reason behind those emotions. This limits the test's validity as a measure of theory of mind. Objectivity and subjectivity - Quantitative Data  A strength of the study was its objectivity, as the data collected was quantitative. The task involved fixed -choice answers, meaning there was no need for interpretation from the researchers. This eliminated researcher bias in analyzing responses and increased the study's validity. Generalizations and Ecological Validity Generalizing Beyond the Sample  A weakness of the study is that its findings may not be generalizable to all individuals with HFA AS. The HFA AS group consisted of only 15 self  selected male adults, which could lead to a biased sample. These participants might have beenparticularly motivated or interested in the study, making them unrepresentative of the broader population with high -functioning autism. Generalizing to Everyday Life  The Eyes Test used static images of eyes, which may not accurately reflect how people process emotions in real -life situations. In real life, individuals use facial movements, verbal, and non -verbal cues to interpret emotions, which means the test lacks ecological validity and does not fully measure real -world ability to recognize mental states. ISSUES AND DEBATES Individual and Situational Explanations  1. Individual Explanation  Adults with HFA AS scored lower on the Eyes Test compared to neurotypical adults, suggesting that individuals with HFA AS may have difficulties with cognitive processing of emotions shown through facial expressions. This supports the idea that there are i ndividual differences in emotional recognition abilities. 2. Situational Explanation  However, it could be argued that people with HFA AS may perform better in some situations than others. For example, they might find recognizing certain emotions, like sadness versus jealousy, more difficult. They may also perform better in situations with fewer distractions and when given more time to process the emotions. Applications to Everyday Life  1. Other Clinical Groups  The Eyes Test could be used with other clinical groups, such as individuals with brain damage, to assess potential deficits in social intelligence. If a patient scores poorly, therapists could intervene to help them improve their emotional recognition skills. 2. Education  The test could be used by educators to assess a student's level of social intelligence. A low score on the Eyes Test could indicate difficulties with theory of mind, prompting teachers to provide additional support and lessons to help the student develop these skills.

They may also perform better in situations with fewer distractions and when given more time to process the emotions. Applications to Everyday Life  1. Other Clinical Groups  The Eyes Test could be used with other clinical groups, such as individuals with brain damage, to assess potential deficits in social intelligence. If a patient scores poorly, therapists could intervene to help them improve their emotional recognition skills. 2. Education  The test could be used by educators to assess a student's level of social intelligence. A low score on the Eyes Test could indicate difficulties with theory of mind, prompting teachers to provide additional support and lessons to help the student develop these skills. Links to assumptions There were differences in Eyes Test score between individuals with HFA AS and neurotypical controls, showing that there are individual differences in people's cognitive processing of emotions shown by facial expressionsBaron -Cohen et al.  eyes test  The challenge in psychology is developing tests sensitive to subtle cognitive dysfunction, particularly in social cognition  Social cognition involves understanding and processing social interactions, emotions, and behaviours  . While there are many tests for young children, few exist for adults with normal intelligence who may have mild social understanding deficits. The "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" Test, developed by Baron -Cohen et al.  1997 , is designed to assess an adult s ability to understand another person's mental state by analyzing the eye -region of faces. This test measures theory of mind, which involves attributing mental states to others, though it only addresses the first stage of theory of mind  identif ying the mental state, not its content  e.g. compassion for her mother s loss . The "Reading the Mind in the Eyes" Test showed that adult males scored an average of 18.8, while females scored slightly higher at 21.8. Adults with high-functioning autism  HFA  or Asperger Syndrome  AS  scored significantly lower  16.3  compared to sex -matched controls and adults with Tourette s syndrome  TS , who scored similarly to the general population  20.4 . The test successfully identified subtle mind -reading difficulti es in adults with HFA or AS, supporting previous findings in children with autism. This demonstrated that normal adults can judge mental states from minimal facial cues, leading to further considerations for improving the test. AIM The main aims were  1. To test adults with high -functioning autism  HFA   Asperger syndrome IASI on the revised eyes test to see if the deficits on the original test were still seen . 2. To see if there is a negative correlation between autism spectrum quotient  AQ  and eyes test scores. 3. To see ff females score higher on the eyes test than males.

SAMPLE   Group 1  Adults with Asperger Syndrome  AS  or High -Functioning Autism  HFA   N   15, all male . They were diagnosed based on established criteria and had normal IQ scores  mean   115, SD   16.1  on the WAIS -R.   Group 2  Normal adults  N   122  from various occupations and educational backgrounds, including both employed and unemployed individuals. Data on age was available for 88 participants.   Group 3  Normal university students  N   103, 53 male, 50 female  from Cambridge University, primarily with high IQ due to stringent entrance requirements.   Group 4  A general population sample  N   14  IQ -matched with Group 1  mean   116, SD   6.4 , with no significant differences in IQ or age between Groups 1 and 4. PROCEDURE Participants in all four groups took the revised eyes test in a quiet room, alone, in either Exeter or Cambridge. The test required them to select which of four words matched the expression of a set of eyes. There was one correct answer and three foils for each set of eyes. Participants with HFA  AS  Group 1  were also asked to determine the gender of the eyes as a control task. The other groups did not need to do this as neurotypical adults  scores have a ceiling effect. Participants were also asked if they were unsure of any words in the glossary and to read the meaning of these. Problems with the original eyes test   Narrow Score Range   Increased the number of items from 25 to 36 and expanded response options from 2 to 4, allowing for a broader score range and reducing ceiling effects.   Distinguishing the "Broader Phenotype"  The previous version couldn't differentiate between individuals with autism and their relatives. The revised version aimed to improve this by increasing the score range.   Complex vs. Basic Mental States   The original test included easy -to-guess basic emotions, which were removed in the revised version, focusing only on complex mental states for greater challenge.   Gaze Direction Clues   Items based on gaze direction  e.g., "noticing" or "ignoring"  were excluded, ensuring a more accurate measure of mind -reading ability.Gender Bias   The original version had more female faces, so the revised test balanced the number of male and female faces to avoid bias.   Difficult Foil Words   Foil words were made more similar in emotional valence to the target word, increasing the difficulty of distinguishing mental states.   Comprehension Issues  A glossary of terms was added to help participants with language difficulties, ensuring that vocabulary comprehension didn t affect performance. Eyes Test Development    Target words and foils   Developed by the first two authors and piloted on eight judges  four male, four female . The criterion for selecting words was that at least five out of eight judges agreed on the target word being the most suitable description, with no more than two judges selecting any foil. Items that didn't meet this criterion were revised and re  piloted.   Item analysis   Data from Groups 2 and 3 were combined, resulting in a sample of N   225. New criteria were applied  at least 50  of participants had to select the target word, and no more than 25  could select any foil. Items not meeting these criteria were dropped, leaving 36 items.   Glossary   A glossary of mental state terms was provided to participants. RESULTS   Group 1  Adults with HFA AS  performed significantly worse on the Eyes Test than the other groups, suggesting that individuals with high -functioning autism or Asperger syndrome have more difficulty reading mental states from the eyes compared to normal adults and students.   Females scored higher than males on the Eyes Test , but this difference was not statistically significant, meaning it might be due to chance or other factors.   Group 1 scored significantly worse on the Autism Spectrum Quotient  AQ  than Groups 3 and 4. This indicates that adults with HFA AS have more traits associated with autism, as measured by the AQ, than normal adults or university students.   Males scored higher than females on the AQ, meaning men generally exhibited more traits related to autism compared to women in the sample.   There was no correlation between Eyes Test score and IQ , indicating that the ability to interpret mental states from the eyes is not directly related to general intelligence.   A negative correlation of -0.531 between the AQ score and Eyes Test score for all groups suggests that as the number of autistic traits  measured by AQ  increases, the ability to read mental states from the eyes decreases. This implies that individuals with more autistic traits struggle more with interpreting emotions or mental states from facial expressions.   In the student group, Eyes Test scores were negatively correlated with social skills and communication categories of the AQ. This suggests that students with poorer social and communication skills tend to score lower on the Eyes Test, meaning they have difficulty understanding mental states from facial expressions.Adults with HFA AS scored highly  33 out of 36 or above  on the gender recognition task, indicating that their difficulty is specific to recognizing mental states from eyes, not general face recognition. CONCLUSIONS The revised Eyes Test proved to be a more sensitive tool for measuring adult social intelligence compared to the original version. Neurotypical adults scored significantly below the ceiling, allowing the test to better detect subtle individual differences in social understanding. Adults with HFA AS showed impairment on the test but were able to successfully identify gender in the control task, confirming that the Eyes Test can effectively detect subtle social impairments in adults with normal IQs and differentiate them from control groups. The negative correlation between AQ  Autism Spectrum Quotient  scores and Eyes Test scores suggests that both tests can be used together to assess the severity of autistic traits , with higher AQ scores corresponding to poorer performance on the Eyes Test. EV ALUATIONS Ethical issues - An ethical weakness of the study is the potential psychological harm to participants with HFA AS , as they may have struggled to understand the emotions depicted in the eyes, leading to distress or embarrassment. This could result in lowered self -esteem after the test. Methodological issues   Reliability - A strength of the study is its high level of standardization , with all participants viewing the same 36 pairs of eyes, consistent image size, black -and-white format, and four response options. A glossary of terms was also provided. This ensures reliability and allows other researchers to replicate the study and re -examine findings, such as the gender differences. Methodological issues   Validity - Lack of Random Allocation  The study could not randomly allocate participants to groups due to naturally occurring variables  e.g., diagnosis of HFA AS, male female . This may have led to participant variables within each group, potentially affecting performance on the Eyes Test an d reducing the validity of the results. Differences observed between groups may not have been solely due to the independent variable. Methodological issues   Validity - Theory of Mind  The study may not have fully measured theory of mind as claimed. It only assessed the first stage of theory of mind  recognizing mental states  without considering the second stage, which involves understanding the reason behind those emotions. This limits the test's validity as a measure of theory of mind. Objectivity and subjectivity - Quantitative Data  A strength of the study was its objectivity, as the data collected was quantitative. The task involved fixed -choice answers, meaning there was no need for interpretation from the researchers. This eliminated researcher bias in analyzing responses and increased the study's validity. Generalizations and Ecological Validity Generalizing Beyond the Sample  A weakness of the study is that its findings may not be generalizable to all individuals with HFA AS. The HFA AS group consisted of only 15 self  selected male adults, which could lead to a biased sample. These participants might have beenparticularly motivated or interested in the study, making them unrepresentative of the broader population with high -functioning autism. Generalizing to Everyday Life  The Eyes Test used static images of eyes, which may not accurately reflect how people process emotions in real -life situations. In real life, individuals use facial movements, verbal, and non -verbal cues to interpret emotions, which means the test lacks ecological validity and does not fully measure real -world ability to recognize mental states. ISSUES AND DEBATES Individual and Situational Explanations  1. Individual Explanation  Adults with HFA AS scored lower on the Eyes Test compared to neurotypical adults, suggesting that individuals with HFA AS may have difficulties with cognitive processing of emotions shown through facial expressions. This supports the idea that there are i ndividual differences in emotional recognition abilities. 2. Situational Explanation  However, it could be argued that people with HFA AS may perform better in some situations than others.

Links to assumptions There were differences in Eyes Test score between individuals with HFA AS and neurotypical controls, showing that there are individual differences in people's cognitive processing of emotions shown by facial expressionsHassett et al.  2008  Aim   To test if sex differences in children's toy preferences are due to biological factors  i.e. exposure to high levels of prenatal androgen  rather than socialisation.   To investigate whether male and female rhesus monkeys have similar toy preferences to human children despite having no experience socialising with human toys. Introducing Kim Wallen and Janice Hassett -Vick Professor Wallen has worked with monkeys for over 50 years, at Emory University and the Yerkes National Primate Research Centre  YNPRC . Hines and Alexander found that male vervet monkeys played more with stereotypical male than female toys. Wallen investi gated whether monkeys showed a preference for sex -typed toys when given a choice between stereotypical male and female toys. He found that the behaviour of monkeys paralleled that of children using a toy -prefe rence task, suggesting that toy preferences are not primarily a result of socialisation, but rather are due to biological differences. Psychology Being Investigated The psychology being investigated is animal play. Play   Seashore  1913  defined play as 'pleasure gained in self -expression'. This definition may apply to some forms of human play, but it does not describe non -human animal play very well as animals do not really have a sense of self to express! Animal play   Bergen  2015  emphasises that play is always voluntary, explaining that we play because we choose to, not because we have to. Play may be adaptive, and it can help individuals practice skills required for adulthood. Sex Differences and the Role of Nature The sex of mammals is determined by sex chromosomes which affect their levels of sex hormones , typically XX for females and XY for males. This causes differences in the development of male and female brains, and consequently, their cognitive processes. In a nursery, boys are more likely to be seen playing with cars, and girls with dolls. However, this doesn t mean that girls don t like playing with cars  in fact, research found that girls like playing with trucks more than boys like playing with dolls. Nature vs Nurture Debate on Toy Preferences Nurture debate   Children learn about gender and societal norms through socialisation, leading them to conform to stereotypical gender roles, and seek out sex -typed toys. Hassett et al., however, reject the socialisation explanation for toy preferenc es and believe in the biological explanation. Nature debate   Boys and girls play with toys which suit their cognitive abilities, and these depend on each child s sex hormone levels. Hence, toys are selected due to the play activities they promote, not due to societal norms on  gender -appropriate  toys. BackgroundCongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia  CAH    An inherited condition where the foetus is exposed to high levels of prenatal androgens  male sex hormones . Hassett et al. were influenced by research on children with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia  CAH . Subsequently, it led them to favour the idea that toy preferences are initially shaped by hormones and not socialisation. Research shows that girls with CAH show a preference for male  stereotyped toys when compared to girls without CAH. Additionally, Pasterski et a l.  2005  found that even when daughters with CAH were encouraged to play with female  stereotyped toys, they still preferred playing with male -stereotyped toys. Previous Research on Monkeys Alexander and Hines  2002  found the following  1. More male vervet monkeys than females played with stereotypically male toys. 2. Unlike humans, male monkeys spent an equal time interacting with male and female toys. 3. Female monkeys showed a strong preference for stereotypical female toys rather than male toys. Research Method, Design and Variables Research Method   Field experiment involving a controlled observation, and a correlational study using a behavioural checklist. Research Design   Independent measures design. Independent Variable   The sex of the monkey  male or female . Dependent Variable   Whether the monkeys interacted more with the plush toys or the wheeled toys. When the monkeys interacted with the toys, their social rank and age were recorded. Social rank had already been determined by observing grooming behaviour  the monkey doing the grooming is alw ays subordinate has less social status than the monkey being groomed. Sample     Originally, 135 monkeys were from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center Field Station, but 53 were excluded, hence only 82 took part   61 females and 21 males.   There were infant and adult monkeys.   34 monkeys  23 females   11 males  interacted with the toys on more than 5 occasions, therefore, their data was included in the analysis.   Reasons for excluding the 53 monkeys  o 14 had previously participated in research on prenatal hormones so they weren t included in the current study  to reduce demand characteristics and order effects . o 39 were excluded since they were too young, and it was hard to tell their sex.Procedure Seven 25 -minute trials were completed in the outdoor enclosure, each with a different pair of toys. Before each observation, observers placed a pair of toys  1 wheeled, 1 plush  outside while the monkeys waited inside. Toys were placed 10 metres apart and their positions were counterbalanced  to ensu re the monkeys didn t prefer a certain area of the enclosure . The toys varied in shape, size, and colour, and were selected on what you could  do  with them. There were    6 wheeled toys  wagon, truck, car, construction vehicle, shopping cart and dump truck, ranging from 16 to 46 cm.   7 plush toys  Winnie -the-Pooh, Raggedy -Ann, Scooby -Doo and four soft toy animals, including a koala, armadillo, teddy and turtle, ranging from 14 to 73 cm. Data Collection   A video camera was focused on each toy to record interactions. 2 observers watched the videos and used a behavioural checklist to categorise the behaviour of the monkeys. They recorded the data using the app Handobs on their palm pilots  a device simila r to mobile phones . Data recorded by observers  The start and finish time of each interaction, and from this they calculated the duration. The monkey s age, sex, and rank. Behavioural checklist included  extended touching, holding, sitting on, dragging, carrying, etc. Examples of operationalised behaviours     Extended touch   Placing a hand or foot on the toy.   Sit on   Seated on the toy or a part of the toy. Results Most monkeys didn t interact with the toys. Only very few interacted frequently and for long. Data of  17 - 3 males and 14 females   monkeys who showed less than 5 behaviours were excluded.   Male monkeys played with wheeled toys for a longer time than female monkeys. However, the standard deviation was high, meaning that some males played for longer than others.   Female monkeys played with plush toys for a longer time than male monkeys. There wasn t a significant difference in time spent playing with wheeled or plush toys.   Social Rank   A significant positive correlation between social rank  dominance of monkeys  and frequency of interaction was found. - Higher -ranking monkeys interacted more with the toys.- Female monkeys who preferred plush toys had a higher rank than those who had no preference. Results - Male Monkeys   Male monkeys preferred wheeled toys  mean   9.77 , compared to plush toys  mean   2.06 . Males played with plush toys less than females.   73  of males preferred wheeled toys and only 9  preferred plush toys. 18  showed no significant preference. These preferences were not affected by age or rank. Results - Female Monkeys   Female monkeys showed no preference, other than an insignificant preference for plush toys. Mean plush toys preference   7.97. Mean wheeled toys preference   6.96.   Only 30  of females preferred plush toys, whereas 39  preferred wheeled toys, and 30  showed no significant preference. Conclusions 1. Sex-typed preferences in humans may be due to biological differences because even without differences in socialisation, monkeys showed preferences similar to human infants. Male monkeys similar to boys, have a strong preference for masculine -type toys. Whe reas female monkeys are more variable in their toy preferences. 2. Toy preferences reflect behavioural and cognitive biases which have been influenced by hormones. Strengths 1. Ethical guidelines on treating lab animals were followed by researchers when caring for the monkeys. They had constant access to water, they were fed monkey chow twice a day, and fruits and vegetables every day. 2. Using the operationalised behavioural checklist increased the validity and reliability of results, as it guided researchers on how to record observations in the same way. For example, the behaviour  sit on  was described as sitting on or part of a toy. 3. Different pairs of toys were used on each trial, and this increased the validity as we can determine that males were drawn to wheeled toys in general, and not just a specific wheeled toy. 4. Using video cameras increased the validity of the data recorded because the monkeys were used to the cameras. If a researcher recorded data in person instead, the monkeys might show demand characteristics by playing more or less with the toys. 5. Quantitative data collected on toy interaction duration allowed for the objective calculations of the average time the monkeys spent with the toys. This removes room for subjective interpretations.Weaknesses 1. The standardised procedure was abandoned for a trial because a monkey tore a plush toy causing the trial to be stopped 7 minutes early. This reduces the reliability of results. 2. There is a chance observer bias may have increased subjectivity . The researchers who analysed the tapes were familiar with the monkeys and their gender and this could have led them to unintentionally code the behaviour of the monkeys differently to their actual behaviour. 3. There was a lack of adult males in the sample, hence reducing the generalisability of results. The only one high -ranking male didn t interact with any toys, hence, findings can only be generalised to lower -ranking, non -adult male monkeys. 4. Ecological validity is low because the sample consisted of monkeys in captivity, and they might be more likely to show interest in new objects in their environment. Therefore, we can t entirely generalise results to explain if wild monkeys behave in the same way. 5. Validity is low because, in each trial, a group of monkeys were sent out. So if one monkey occupied the wheeled toy, another monkey wanting to play with a toy would go to the plush toy regardless of their personal preference. Nature vs Nurture Hassett believed that toy preferences in humans are due to nature because male monkeys prefer wheeled toys over plush toys, whereas females show no clear preference. Findings supported the nurture debate that interactions were affected by social rank. Fema le monkeys' social rank was positively correlated with the time spent interacting with both toys. However, female dominance is influenced by testosterones which is a biological effect. Applications to everyday life Findings are helpful when choosing toys for children. Results suggest that boys like moving toys, so if a parent wants to develop their empathy, toy vehicles with expressive faces can be bought. As girls like plush toys with faces, their visuospatial skill s can be improved by using toys with moving parts but in a context where dolls are included. For example, playing a scene with toy school buses and dolls.
