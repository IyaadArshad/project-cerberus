particularly motivated or interested in the study, making them unrepresentative of the broader population with high -functioning autism. Generalizing to Everyday Life  The Eyes Test used static images of eyes, which may not accurately reflect how people process emotions in real -life situations. In real life, individuals use facial movements, verbal, and non -verbal cues to interpret emotions, which means the test lacks ecological validity and does not fully measure real -world ability to recognize mental states. ISSUES AND DEBATES Individual and Situational Explanations  1. Individual Explanation  Adults with HFA AS scored lower on the Eyes Test compared to neurotypical adults, suggesting that individuals with HFA AS may have difficulties with cognitive processing of emotions shown through facial expressions. This supports the idea that there are i ndividual differences in emotional recognition abilities. 2. Situational Explanation  However, it could be argued that people with HFA AS may perform better in some situations than others. For example, they might find recognizing certain emotions, like sadness versus jealousy, more difficult. They may also perform better in situations with fewer distractions and when given more time to process the emotions. Applications to Everyday Life  1. Other Clinical Groups  The Eyes Test could be used with other clinical groups, such as individuals with brain damage, to assess potential deficits in social intelligence. If a patient scores poorly, therapists could intervene to help them improve their emotional recognition skills. 2. Education  The test could be used by educators to assess a student's level of social intelligence. A low score on the Eyes Test could indicate difficulties with theory of mind, prompting teachers to provide additional support and lessons to help the student develop these skills. Links to assumptions There were differences in Eyes Test score between individuals with HFA AS and neurotypical controls, showing that there are individual differences in people's cognitive processing of emotions shown by facial expressions
